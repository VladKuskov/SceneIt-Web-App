# Movie Catalog API

A RESTful backend app built with Spring Boot to manage a movie catalog. This project helped me learn core backend concepts like CRUD, REST APIs, data persistence, and dependency management. Built with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL and Maven.

- RESTful API with routing and validation
- Tested MVC architecture with service/repo layers
- Built the ability to update, delete, and search movies by genre, rating, or overall popularity score (rating 1-100).
